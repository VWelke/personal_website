# 📡 Cosmic Ray Anomaly Project

## 🔍 Summary
This project involved analyzing high-energy cosmic ray events using simulation datasets from [source name]. We investigated unexpected directional clustering.

## ⚙️ Methodology
- Data: XYZ survey (1M+ data points)
- Tools: Python, Matplotlib, SciPy
- Filtering: energies > 10^19 eV

## 📈 Results

Our simulation shows a 3σ excess in one sky region, potentially indicating magnetic lensing.

## 📚 Conclusion
This pattern could inform our understanding of cosmic ray origins and Galactic magnetic fields.
