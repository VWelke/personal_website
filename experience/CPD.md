# Observability of Circum-Planetary Disk


Circum-planetary disks are XXXXXX.

##  Methodology
- Data: XYZ survey (1M+ data points)
- Tools: Python, Matplotlib, SciPy
- Filtering: energies > 10^19 eV

## Results

![Cosmic Ray Plot]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cosmic-ray-plot.png)

Our simulation shows a 3σ excess in one sky region, potentially indicating magnetic lensing.

## Conclusion
This pattern could inform our understanding of cosmic ray origins and Galactic magnetic fields.
